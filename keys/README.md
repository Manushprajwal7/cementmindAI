# GCP Credentials

To enable fetching data from Google Cloud Storage, you need to:

1. Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
2. Download the JSON key file
3. Rename it to `gcp-key.json` and place it in this directory

The service account needs permissions to read from the `cementmind` bucket.
